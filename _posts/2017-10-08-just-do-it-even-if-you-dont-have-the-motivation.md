I often don't have the motivation to work on something. I'm sure I'm not alone. We all have the moments when we don't want to do something even if we were excited about it in the past. At the beginning, we have the interest, but when the time goes by, maybe a month, a week or just one day, we think that it's not so interesting anymore.

I remember myself in the past, how I struggled with such problems. Usually, it was about not doing anything. I was thinking that if I don't have the motivation to do something, then I shouldn't do it. I should find my passion then I will always have the motivation. I thought that people who had succeeded found their passion and always have the motivation.

Now I'm certain that it doesn't work like that. All successful people had a discipline, not a motivation. It doesn't matter what you are doing. You will always have the moments when you will be thinking that it's boring or not interesting. But you should continue even if you don't have the motivation. I remember one day when I didn't have the motivation to write at all. But I forced myself and after some time it became easy. And this is not the only case in my life. It happens quite often.

And I'm not saying that you should force yourself to do the thing that you completely hated from the beginning. I'm saying that you should continue to do what you have started with interest and curiosity, and finish it despite the lack of motivation. It's a waste of time to start a project, write a book, or anything else and not to finish it. You can't present a part of the book. You can't present an uncompleted project. You have to finish it. But in order to finish it, you should develop your discipline.

And don't worry, discipline is just a skill. It's not genetic or anything like that.

> Discipline is doing what you know needs to be done, even if you don't want to do it.

So, in conclusion. Motivation appears and disappears. Don't trust this feeling. Make a plan of what you are supposed to do on the next day and just execute it.
